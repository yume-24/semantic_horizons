Okay, so... dreams have always felt kind of mysterious to me. Sometimes I wake up and remember this really strange, vivid story, and other times it’s just gone. I’ve always wondered if dreams mean anything, or if they’re just brain junk from the day. I’ve had dreams that feel super emotional—like ones where someone I care about is hurt or gone—and I wake up feeling weird all day. It makes me wonder why those dreams stick more than random ones where I’m flying or walking through a weird house. I’ve heard that certain symbols in dreams have specific meanings, like if you lose teeth it means anxiety, or flying means freedom. But I’m not sure if those are universal or just made-up interpretations. I guess it depends on the person and what’s going on in their life. Sometimes I’ll have the same kind of dream over and over, like I’m late for a class or lost in a building. That makes me think there’s some kind of pattern in what my brain is doing, even if I don’t get it. I think it’d be interesting to keep a dream journal and look for patterns over time. I don’t know if dreams have deep meaning, but I do think they’re a window into how we feel or what we’re stressed about—even if we don’t realize it while we’re awake.
