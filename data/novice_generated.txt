Okay, so, um, the car, like, it won’t start. You know, I tried turning the key, and it just, like, makes a noise. Not a big noise, like a small clicky noise, and then nothing. It doesn’t go. It just doesn’t go. I thought maybe, like, I don’t know, the battery? Maybe the battery is dead or something. I think it’s the battery. So, I think, okay, I’ll try to fix it. I don’t really fix cars much, but, like, I think maybe I can figure it out.

So first, I go to the front of the car and open the, um, the front part. The hood. I open the hood. It’s a bit tricky, you know? You gotta pull a thing inside, then you go to the front and lift it. I couldn’t get it the first time, but then I found the little lever under the hood and got it open.

Then I see the battery. I think it’s the battery. It’s a big, black box with wires. Two wires. One is red and one is black. I think red is good, and black is, like, ground or something. That’s what I heard.

So I look at the battery, and I think, okay, maybe I need to jump it. You know, jump-start it. I seen that before. My friend did it once. You take the other car and put the wires, like, from one battery to the other battery. Red to red. Black to black. I think.

So I got some jumper cables. They’re like these wires with clips. They got teeth. They bite the metal. I got my neighbor to help. He had a car that worked. So we put the cars close, like, really close, but not touching. That’s important, I think.

Then I put the red clip on the red battery thing on the dead car. Then I put the other red clip on the good car’s red battery thing. Then the black on the good car black one. Then the other black on a metal thing. I heard it shouldn’t go on the battery, or it might spark. So I put it on, like, a bolt on the car.

Then my neighbor started his car. It made a sound, and it ran. Then I tried starting my car. I turned the key, and it clicked, then it started. It worked! It worked! That was really good.

I was like, wow, I fixed it. But then I thought, maybe it’ll die again. Like, what if the battery is bad? I think I should check that. But I don’t really know how. I think if it keeps dying, I should maybe buy a new battery. Or maybe take it to the car shop and they can look.

I asked someone, and they said, like, you can check the battery with a thing. A meter. It tells you if it’s charged. Like a number. Over 12 is good. Under 12 is bad. I don’t have that, so I didn’t check.

Also, I heard, like, you should check the cables. If they’re dirty, it won’t work. Like, the metal can get all white and fuzzy. That’s called, um, corrosion. I didn’t know that, but now I do. I looked at the cables and they looked okay.

So now the car works, but I think maybe I should drive it a bit, like, to charge the battery. Someone told me that. If you drive the car, the battery charges up. But if you just jump it and don’t drive, it dies again. So I drove to the store and back. It was okay.

But I’m still a bit scared it’ll not work again. So maybe I’ll go to a shop. I don’t really know how to fix cars for real. Just little stuff. Like jumping the car, I can do that now. But if it’s something else, I don’t know. Like the starter. Or the alternator. I don’t really know what those do, but people talk about them.

If it happens again, I guess I’ll ask someone. Or maybe call a mechanic. They know stuff. I wish I knew more, but, like, it’s kind of hard. Cars are complicated.

So, to fix the car, I opened the hood, looked at the battery, jumped the car, and now it works. I don’t know if it’ll keep working, but for now, it’s good. I learned some stuff. Like, red is power. Black is ground. Don’t let the clips touch. Put black on metal. Stuff like that.

Maybe next time I’ll get a battery tester. Or go to a shop. But at least I tried. I think that’s good.

Yeah, so, that’s how I fixed the car. I guess.
