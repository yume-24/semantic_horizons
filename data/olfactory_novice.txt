Okay so... olfactory memory, right? I didn’t even know that was a thing until someone mentioned it in a podcast. It’s basically how certain smells can bring back memories—like, out of nowhere. I remember walking past a bakery one day and suddenly feeling this weird kind of nostalgia. The smell reminded me of my grandmother’s kitchen, even though I hadn’t thought about that in years. It was instant, and it kind of hit me in the chest, you know? It made me realize that smell isn’t just background noise—it really sticks. Like, more than a photo or a song sometimes. I guess I just didn’t think of it as being connected to memory like that. Now I wonder if other people experience that as strongly. Are there smells that are universal triggers? Or is it all based on personal stuff? And why don’t we talk about this more in school or science classes? It’s kind of wild to think your brain is keeping track of all these scents and just waiting for the right one to show up again. I wonder how many memories we forget until a smell brings them back.
