Mental health is one of those topics I didn’t think much about until I or someone close to me started struggling. Then it kind of became this huge thing that’s always there, even if people don’t talk about it. When I hear 'mental health,' I think of anxiety, depression, burnout. But I’ve learned it’s not just about having a disorder—it’s about how you handle stress, relationships, even how you feel about yourself. I’ve had periods where I felt fine on the outside but exhausted inside. I didn’t know what to call it. I didn’t want to say 'depressed' because that felt too extreme. But I also knew it wasn’t normal. It’s hard to explain to people when nothing looks wrong. Therapy helped me realize that a lot of my thought patterns were working against me. I’d blame myself for everything, expect the worst, or feel like I had to be perfect all the time. Just having someone to talk to and name those things made a huge difference. I also started learning about how childhood experiences affect your adult mental health. Things like how your parents talked to you, or whether you felt safe. I used to think those things didn’t matter, but now I see how much they shape your emotional habits. It’s frustrating that there’s still so much stigma. Like, people are okay saying they go to the gym or take vitamins, but saying 'I go to therapy' still feels like a confession. I think if we talked about it more, more people would get help before things get worse.
