Time perception is something I think about a lot, but mostly just in everyday life. Like, why does time go by fast when I’m having fun, but feel super slow when I’m bored or anxious? I’ve heard people say 'time flies when you’re having fun,' and I’ve definitely felt that. Sometimes I’ll look at the clock thinking 20 minutes passed and it’s only been five. Other times, I think a whole hour must have gone by, and it’s been two. I’ve always wondered what’s really going on there—like, is it just attention? Or does the brain actually track time like a stopwatch? I remember reading something about how we don’t have a 'time sense' the way we have sight or hearing. Instead, our brains kind of build a sense of time from other information—like what we’re doing or how much is happening. I also wonder how drugs or emotions affect time. Like when I’m really anxious, everything slows down and I notice more details. Or when I’m excited, everything blurs together and time vanishes. That makes me think time isn’t fixed—it’s something we experience differently depending on the situation. I’d love to understand more about how scientists study time. It seems like such a weird thing to measure because it’s not something you can see or touch, but we all feel it.
