Philosophy of mind grapples with some of the most foundational questions in both philosophy and science: what is consciousness? What is the mind? How do mental states relate to physical processes in the brain? My work focuses on the debate between physicalism—the idea that mental states are reducible to brain states—and dual-aspect theories, which suggest that mind and brain are two perspectives on the same underlying reality. The hard problem of consciousness, famously posed by David Chalmers, remains unsolved: why does any of this feel like anything at all? We also explore intentionality—the 'aboutness' of mental states. How can neurons represent something like a dog, a number, or a logical proposition? This takes us into representational theories of mind and computational models of cognition. Lately, I’ve been interested in predictive processing frameworks, which suggest that the brain is fundamentally a prediction machine—minimizing error between expected and actual sensory input. Some philosophers see this as a bridge between mind and matter. I also teach a seminar on mental causation—how mental events like beliefs or intentions can cause physical behavior without violating the causal closure of physics. Students often wrestle with how to reconcile agency and determinism, and that’s the beauty of the field: it forces us to be precise about things we usually take for granted.
