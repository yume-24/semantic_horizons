Decision making—this is one of those topics that seems deceptively simple but becomes deeply complex once you try to formalize it. In cognitive science and behavioral economics, we distinguish between normative models—what a perfectly rational agent would do—and descriptive models, which is what people actually do. My research focuses on the tension between those two. We run experiments using things like the Iowa Gambling Task or multi-armed bandits to assess how people make sequential choices under uncertainty. One thing we find consistently is that people aren’t irrational—they’re bounded. They’re working with limited time, cognitive resources, and incomplete information. So we try to model those constraints using frameworks like bounded rationality or reinforcement learning. What fascinates me is how much our environment shapes decision heuristics. In a noisy setting, people might rely more on habits. In high-stakes situations, they tend to anchor on the most emotionally salient outcome, even if it’s statistically unlikely. We’ve started incorporating affective computing measures, like galvanic skin response and eye-tracking, to get a physiological trace of decision conflict. There’s also a growing field of computational psychiatry where decision models help us understand conditions like OCD or addiction. In those contexts, maladaptive decisions can stem from dysregulated value updating or impaired risk sensitivity. The hope is that by modeling these quantitatively, we can inform more targeted interventions. The real world is full of tradeoffs. What’s the cost of waiting for more information? What’s the cost of making the wrong decision now? That’s why I think the most interesting research right now is happening at the intersection of cognitive modeling, behavioral data, and real-time adaptive systems. Decision making is not just a mental process—it’s a lived one. One question we’re starting to explore more is how metacognition—thinking about your own thinking—affects decision quality. Do people who reflect on their choices perform better over time? Can that ability be trained? We also see interesting developmental trajectories. Adolescents take more risks not necessarily because they don’t understand the consequences, but because the dopamine system makes reward more salient. It’s a rational response to a different cost-benefit landscape. Another exciting frontier is using real-world, passive data—like phone usage or movement patterns—to infer decision habits outside the lab. It’s messier than lab data, but it tells us how people actually live.
