Nutrition… yeah, that’s a huge focus in my current research—especially micronutrient absorption and how gut health 
mediates long-term metabolic outcomes. What people often overlook is how dynamic nutrition science really is. It’s not 
just about counting calories. We're talking about hormonal regulation, glycemic variability, nutrient timing, and 
interactions between food compounds. In my lab, we’re studying how different gut microbiome compositions affect 
nutrient bioavailability—especially iron and vitamin D.

One of the areas I find most interesting is how even short-term dietary shifts—like going low-carb for a few weeks—can 
alter microbial diversity and have downstream effects on mood and cognition. And there’s so much misinformation out 
there. The idea that there’s one optimal diet for everyone is... well, it’s just not supported by the data. Nutrigenomics 
is showing us that people metabolize foods differently depending on their genetic variants. So personalization is going 
to be key in the next wave of clinical nutrition.

We’ve also been investigating food insecurity—not just from an economic perspective but also the psychological burden 
that erratic access to quality nutrition places on individuals. It’s not just a physiological issue. It’s behavioral. 
It’s social. And the policies haven’t really caught up to what we know from public health.

My favorite part is mentoring students who think they know what “healthy eating” means, and then watch them completely 
shift their understanding after learning about systems biology. It’s humbling—nutrition is so much more complex than 
"eat your vegetables."
