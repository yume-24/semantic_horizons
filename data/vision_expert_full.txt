Visual perception is one of the most heavily studied areas in cognitive neuroscience, and for good reason—vision dominates our sensory experience. My research focuses on the neural coding of mid-level visual features—things like shape contours, surface texture, and spatial frequency—and how those features contribute to object recognition. We use a mix of fMRI, EEG, and psychophysical tasks to map out the stages of the visual hierarchy, from V1 all the way up to the inferotemporal cortex. What’s fascinating is how early processing is so fast and feedforward, but later stages involve feedback loops, attention modulation, and even top-down expectation. There’s also a growing interest in how perception isn’t just passive. We now think of it as inference—where the brain makes predictions about the world and updates based on sensory input. That’s why illusions are so interesting: they reveal the assumptions the system is making. We’ve started integrating machine vision comparisons as well—like testing how convolutional neural networks respond to the same distorted or occluded images we give to human participants. The parallels are informative, but also highlight key differences in generalization and robustness. Understanding vision isn’t just about biology—it helps in everything from building better prosthetics to designing more readable user interfaces. It’s one of the rare domains where theory and application constantly feed into each other. We're also studying how attention acts as a filter. It's not just about what reaches your eyes, but what your brain decides to process further. Selective attention can modulate neural responses as early as V2 and V4 in the visual stream. Some of the most exciting work is happening at the intersection of perception and action—how vision guides motor planning. This has implications for robotics and prosthetics, where feedback loops are essential. And increasingly, we’re interested in individual differences. Why do some people notice fine-grained visual detail while others miss it? Is it training, genetics, or something else entirely? There’s still so much to uncover.
