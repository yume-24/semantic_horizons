Okay, so... cryptography is the science of secure communication—it’s about transforming information in ways that make it unreadable to unauthorized parties while still being accessible to intended recipients. It spans ancient ciphers to modern-day public key systems and quantum-resistant algorithms. Modern cryptography is built on mathematical hardness assumptions. For example, RSA encryption depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, while elliptic curve cryptography relies on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. These are problems that are easy to verify but hard to solve without a key. Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It’s fast and efficient, but key distribution becomes a challenge. Asymmetric cryptography, using public and private key pairs, solves that problem by enabling secure key exchange over insecure channels. Beyond confidentiality, cryptography also provides integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. We use hashes to ensure data hasn’t been altered, digital signatures to confirm origin, and zero-knowledge proofs to verify information without revealing it. One big concern now is post-quantum cryptography. Quantum computers could theoretically break many existing systems by solving hard problems like factoring much faster. So we’re developing new protocols that remain secure even in a quantum future. Cryptography is invisible in daily life but underpins everything—from WhatsApp messages to credit card transactions. It's not just about privacy; it’s about building trust in digital systems.
