When I think of decision making, I think of all the little choices we make every day—what to eat, when to study, whether to text someone back right away or later. Some of those decisions feel automatic, and some feel like they take forever. I’ve always wondered what makes some choices easy and others so hard. I heard about the idea of pros and cons lists, and I’ve tried using those, but sometimes it just makes things more confusing. Like, even when one side has more 'points,' I still don’t feel good about the decision. So I guess there’s more to it than logic? I’ve also read that emotions play a big role. Like, when you’re stressed or tired, you make worse decisions. That definitely feels true for me. I’ll procrastinate or order junk food when I’m low on energy. But when I’m rested and calm, I feel like I can actually weigh my options better. I took a psychology class where we talked about something called 'heuristics,' which are like mental shortcuts. Apparently we use them all the time without even noticing. That made me realize I probably rely on gut feelings more than I thought. I wonder if that’s good or bad—it seems like it depends on the situation. I’m not sure if good decision making can be taught, but I hope so. I’d like to get better at noticing when I’m rushing or avoiding decisions. And I want to learn how to be more aware of what’s influencing me—like habits, stress, or pressure from other people. That seems like the first step.
