Nutrition… yeah, that’s a huge focus in my current research—especially micronutrient absorption and how gut health 
mediates long-term metabolic outcomes. What people often overlook is how dynamic nutrition science really is. It’s not just about counting calories. We're talking about hormonal regulation, glycemic variability, nutrient timing, and interactions between food compounds. In my lab, we’re studying how different gut microbiome compositions affect nutrient bioavailability—especially iron and vitamin D.One of the areas I find most interesting is how even short-term dietary shifts—like going low-carb for a few weeks—can alter microbial diversity and have downstream effects on mood and cognition. And there’s so much misinformation out there. The idea that there’s one optimal diet for everyone is... well, it’s just not supported by the data. Nutrigenomics is showing us that people metabolize foods differently depending on their genetic variants. So personalization is going to be key in the next wave of clinical nutrition. We’ve also been investigating food insecurity—not just from an economic perspective but also the psychological burden that erratic access to quality nutrition places on individuals. It’s not just a physiological issue. It’s behavioral. It’s social. And the policies haven’t really caught up to what we know from public health. My favorite part is mentoring students who think they know what “healthy eating” means, and then watch them completely shift their understanding after learning about systems biology. It’s humbling—nutrition is so much more complex than "eat your vegetables." Something else we’re looking into now is how social eating contexts influence long-term food habits. There’s this whole line of work suggesting that eating alone versus in a group changes not just intake, but metabolic outcomes. And culturally, food is tied into identity, which complicates interventions. You can’t just say 'eat this, not that'—people’s choices are embedded in social routines. I also think a lot about policy. For example, food labeling reform sounds simple, but depending on how information is framed—numeric values versus qualitative symbols—it actually changes purchasing behavior. Behavioral economics plays a big role in nutrition science now. There’s still a big gap in translating evidence to practice, especially with primary care physicians. Most MDs get very little training in nutrition. We're trying to build partnerships where clinical guidelines are shaped by newer findings from nutritional epidemiology and microbiome work.
