Language acquisition... okay, so this is something I’ve been thinking about for years
now—especially how early exposure, multimodal input, and interaction shape the trajectory
of a child’s linguistic development. In my lab, we study both monolingual and bilingual
children, and what’s fascinating is how flexible yet rule-governed their acquisition
pathways are.  A lot of people ask, "Is it all innate?" Well, yes and no. The brain
clearly comes prepared to deal with language, but the input matters immensely. We’ve done
longitudinal studies where children in high-quantity input environments—lots of adult
speech, child-directed speech, joint attention—reach syntactic milestones months earlier
than kids in lower input settings. It's not just quantity though; quality matters. Diverse
vocabulary, varied syntactic frames, pragmatic scaffolding—those things accelerate
acquisition.  And critical periods are real, but maybe not as sharp-edged as we thought.
Phonological learning does seem to peak early—say, before age 2—but morphosyntactic
learning shows plasticity into adolescence. Still, we see a marked drop-off in ultimate
attainment, especially in accent and function word mastery, past certain windows.  There’s
also this ongoing debate between generativist and usage-based models. I find myself
somewhere in between. I think kids extract rules, yes, but I think those rules are
probabilistic and driven by input frequency. Like, they’re mini Bayesian learners—tracking
co-occurrence patterns, adjusting hypotheses, revising over time.  We’ve been
incorporating eye-tracking and EEG into our work now. With EEG, we can detect ERP
components like the N400 and P600 during sentence processing, even in toddlers. That gives
us real-time insight into whether they're treating certain constructions as grammatical or
anomalous. Honestly, the data has really pushed us to rethink what counts as
“understanding.”  And lately, we’ve been working with L2 learners too—especially heritage
speakers. That’s a whole different set of variables: identity, literacy, code-switching
norms, and community support. But it's all language learning, and it’s all telling us
something about how flexible and constrained the system is.  It’s a rich field. You’ve got
behavioral experiments, corpus studies, computational modeling—it’s a multi-method
ecosystem. No single approach will explain everything. But what I love most is that
language acquisition research is always, at its heart, about people learning to connect
with one another.
