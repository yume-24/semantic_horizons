Okay, so… nutrition. I guess when I think about it, I mostly just think of what you’re supposed to eat to be healthy. 
Like, fruits, vegetables, less sugar, stuff like that. I’ve definitely grown up hearing all kinds of things about food—like 
carbs are bad, or fats are worse, or you should do intermittent fasting—but honestly I get confused. There’s so much 
information online and a lot of it contradicts itself.

I try to eat well, but I also don’t really know what “well” means anymore. Some people swear by keto, others say 
you need a balanced plate. I did learn recently that gut health is a big deal. Like, I didn’t even know we had so 
many bacteria in our stomachs that do useful stuff.

I’m curious how much of what we eat actually affects things like energy or mood. Sometimes I eat a lot of junk and 
feel fine, but other times I crash. I guess it’s not all immediate.

And supplements—do they really work? I take vitamin D sometimes but I don’t even know if I need it. I feel like 
nutrition should be simple, but the more I learn, the more complicated it seems. It makes me want to take a real class 
on it. I’ve also started paying more attention to how I feel after eating certain foods. Like, sometimes I’ll have a meal that’s mostly protein and veggies and I feel full but not sluggish. Other times I’ll have something sugary and get tired really fast. But I’m not really tracking anything—just kind of noticing. I downloaded a calorie tracker once, but it got exhausting. I think part of me just wants to eat intuitively, but I don’t trust myself to know what’s right. So I keep going back and forth between trying to follow rules and just eating what feels okay. Lately I’ve been seeing stuff online about 'intuitive eating' and 'gut reset plans'—it’s hard to tell what’s actually backed by science and what’s just trendy.
