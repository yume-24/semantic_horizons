Visual art is something I’ve always been drawn to, even though I’m not great at making it myself. When I walk into a museum or see something cool on the street, I feel something—sometimes calm, sometimes confused—but it definitely sticks with me. I used to think art was mostly about being realistic—like drawing something that looks exactly like a person or a tree. But then I started seeing abstract or surreal stuff, and realized art can also be about feeling, or even just color and movement. One thing I’ve wondered is how people decide what’s 'good' art. Like, some pieces look super simple but are in big museums. I know there’s history and context behind them, but it’s hard to get sometimes without someone explaining it. I follow a few artists on social media, and I love seeing their process—how they go from an idea to a finished piece. It makes me appreciate the work behind it more, even if I don’t totally understand the style. I think I’d like to take an art appreciation class at some point. Not because I want to become an artist, but just to learn how to talk about what I see—and maybe even figure out why some images stay with me for days.
