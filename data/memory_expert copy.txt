Memory isn’t just the storage of facts—it’s a dynamic process involving encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and reconsolidation. My research focuses on how episodic memories are formed and stabilized over time, particularly during sleep. We use polysomnography and fMRI to track how neural activity during sleep affects memory consolidation. One thing we’ve discovered is that slow-wave sleep, especially in the first half of the night, is critical for declarative memory consolidation. And the hippocampus plays a central role in that. What’s fascinating is that memory reactivation can be detected in sleep—through techniques like targeted memory reactivation, we can even cue memories during sleep to improve recall. We’re also studying how memory is constructive. People often think of memory like a hard drive, but it’s more like storytelling—it’s prone to blending, distortion, and inference. That’s why eyewitness testimony can be unreliable. And why people can remember things that never actually happened. In clinical work, we see that memory impairments are often among the earliest signs of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. But we’re also finding that emotional memories, even in healthy individuals, are more resilient. The amygdala seems to tag those memories as important, so they’re retained longer and more vividly. The more we study memory, the more we realize it’s not just about the past—it’s about the future too. Episodic memory helps us simulate possible futures, evaluate outcomes, and make decisions. In that sense, remembering and imagining are two sides of the same coin.
