Time perception is one of the most fascinating areas of study in cognitive science because it underlies virtually every mental process we have, and yet it’s so fluid—so susceptible to context. My research looks at how subjective time is encoded and reconstructed, especially under conditions like boredom, fear, or attention shifts. In the lab, we use interval estimation tasks and EEG to look at how people encode short intervals, like 1 to 5 seconds. One of the striking things is that time perception seems to rely heavily on attention and working memory. If you're distracted, intervals feel shorter. If you're focused, they feel longer. We’re also exploring how different neural oscillations correlate with time perception. Theta and beta rhythms in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are key candidates. And of course, there's the role of dopamine—it seems to act as a regulator or pacemaker signal. That’s why time seems to fly when you’re having fun or slows down during danger. Another area that’s really interesting is retrospective versus prospective timing. When you know you’ll be estimating time, you behave differently—your attention is more on the passage of time itself. But when you’re just asked afterward, it’s more memory-based and influenced by event complexity. We're also looking at clinical populations—people with Parkinson’s or ADHD, for example—because their time perception profiles are consistently different. That opens up the possibility of using time perception as a cognitive marker for certain disorders.
