Creativity… um, I guess I think of it as like coming up with new ideas, or being good at art or music or writing. 
I used to think some people were just born creative and others weren’t, but I don’t know if that’s actually true.

Sometimes I feel creative when I’m drawing or journaling, but other times I just feel blocked. I’ve noticed that I 
tend to get ideas when I’m not trying too hard—like, when I’m walking or taking a shower. I heard somewhere that 
your brain needs time to wander to come up with stuff.

I also wonder if creativity has anything to do with intelligence. Like, do smart people tend to be more creative, 
or are those totally different things? I’ve met people who are great at solving problems in unique ways, even if 
they’re not super academic.

Anyway, I think creativity matters in more ways than just making art. Like in engineering or business, being creative 
can help you find solutions that aren’t obvious. I’d like to learn how to be more creative on purpose, not just when 
it randomly happens. I’ve noticed I get the best ideas when I’m relaxed or kind of daydreaming. When I’m stressed, nothing comes. I wish school gave us more chances to explore stuff without needing it to be graded. Sometimes I write poems or doodle, and I never really thought of that as 'creative work' until someone said it was. I think a lot of people do creative things without realizing it. I’ve also wondered if creativity is something you can practice—like, if you keep trying to come up with new ideas, does it get easier over time? Or do you just wait for inspiration to strike?
