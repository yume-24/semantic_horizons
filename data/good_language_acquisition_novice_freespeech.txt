Okay, language acquisition… I think that means how we learn to speak and understand
language, right? Like, how babies go from just crying and cooing to actually saying words
and forming sentences. It seems kind of magical, honestly. I mean, no one sits a baby down
and teaches them grammar rules, and yet somehow, by the time they’re like two or three,
they’re already putting words together.  I remember reading something in class about how
there's a theory that we’re born with a kind of blueprint for language? Like this idea
that our brains are wired to pick it up. I think it was called Universal Grammar? But then
there’s also the view that we learn it mostly through experience, like hearing adults
talk, getting corrected, that kind of thing.  I have a younger cousin and I’ve watched her
go from babbling to saying full-on questions, like “Where did the bunny go?” and I don’t
know how she figured that out. It’s not like anyone told her how to form a question. So
yeah, it’s super interesting.  I also heard that it’s easier to learn a language when
you’re young. Like, little kids can learn two languages at the same time without mixing
them up too badly. But when adults try, it’s way harder. I’ve been trying to learn Korean
for a couple of years and I still can’t roll my Rs or get the sentence endings right.  One
thing I’m curious about is whether people learn language differently if they don’t hear it
enough as kids. Like, do they catch up later or is there kind of a deadline? I guess I
want to learn more about the science behind it. Right now, I’m just going off what I’ve
seen or heard from friends.  It feels like one of those things we all experience, but
don’t really think about until we study it.
